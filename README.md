# Market Liquidity Analysis with Agent-Based Modeling and LLM

A comprehensive analysis of market liquidity using agent-based modeling (ABM), enhanced with LLM-powered market insights and sophisticated trading strategies to simulate realistic market dynamics.

## Project Structure

### 1. Basic Liquidity Analysis (`basic liqudity anylisys.ipynb`)
- Simple implementation of market liquidity analysis
- Features basic trader and market maker agents
- Simulates basic trading dynamics
- Calculates fundamental liquidity metrics
- Visualizes price movements and basic market behavior

### 2. Liquidity Analysis with ABM (`liqudity anylisys with abm.ipynb`)
- Enhanced agent-based modeling approach
- More sophisticated trader and market maker behaviors
- Advanced market mechanics implementation
- Multiple liquidity metrics tracking
- Detailed visualization of market dynamics
- Includes market depth and volume analysis

### 3. ABM with LLM Integration (`abm with llm , liquditidy anylisys.ipynb`)
- Integration of Language Model for market analysis
- Advanced market simulation with AI-powered insights
- Real-time market condition analysis
- Sophisticated trading strategies
- Comprehensive visualization suite
- Enhanced decision-making mechanisms

## Project Aims
1. Simulate realistic market behavior using agent-based modeling
2. Analyze market liquidity through multiple metrics
3. Enhance market analysis with LLM-powered insights
4. Understand the relationship between trader behavior and market liquidity
5. Develop more accurate market simulation models

## Conclusions
1. Agent-based modeling provides valuable insights into market liquidity dynamics
2. LLM integration enhances the quality of market analysis
3. Market maker behavior significantly impacts overall market liquidity
4. Trading strategies affect market depth and volume patterns
5. Complex interactions between agents create realistic market conditions

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Mesa (Agent-Based Modeling framework)
- Hugging Face Transformers
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- yfinance

## Future Improvements
